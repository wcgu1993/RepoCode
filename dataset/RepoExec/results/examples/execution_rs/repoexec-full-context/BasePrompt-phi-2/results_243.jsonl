However,\n    it is necessary in ``await``-based coroutines, or to pass\n    the ``quiet_exceptions`` argument.\n\n    This function is available under the names ``multi()`` and ``Multi()``\n    for historical reasons.\n\n    Cancelling a `.Future` returned by ``multi()`` does not cancel its\n    children. `asyncio.gather` is similar to ``multi()``, but it does\n    cancel its children.\n\n    .. versionchanged:: 4.2\n    If multiple yieldables fail, any exceptions after the first\n    (which is raised) will be logged. Added the ``quiet_exceptions``\n    argument to suppress this logging for selected exception types.\n\n    .. versionchanged:: 4.3\n    Replaced the class ``Multi`` and the function ``multi_future``\n    with a unified function ``multi``. Added support for yieldables\n    other than ``YieldPoint`` and `.Future`.\n\n    \"\"\"_set_exc_info(future, sys.exc_info())\n       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n", "passed": false}
