Emitting a warning strongly implies the use of a logging mechanism. This node describes a function that configures and returns logging handlers, making it highly probable for invocation to support the warning emission."}, {"fname": "process_request_meta", "evidence": "The target function needs to parse various cURL command options into a dictionary of request keyword arguments. It is plausible that a 'meta' option, if present in the cURL command, would need to be parsed from a JSON string, which is precisely what this function does, including error handling for invalid JSON."}, {"fname": "process_request_cb_kwargs", "evidence": "Similar to the 'meta' option, a 'cbkwargs' option might be present in a cURL command as a JSON string, requiring parsing into a Python object. This function directly provides the capability to handle such a specific command-line argument, including validation and error handling."}, {"fname": "logformatter_adapter", "evidence": "The target function's docstring explicitly states that 'a warning is emitted when cURL options are unknown'. This function adapts log keywords for `logger.log` calls and handles `warnings.warn`, making it a potential utility for emitting such warnings or logging related messages within the target function's implementation."}, {"fname": "_auto_detect_fun", "evidence": "The target function converts a cURL command into request kwargs, which may include a 'data' field. If the encoding of this 'data' is not explicitly provided in the cURL command's headers, the function might need to auto-detect its character encoding using a utility like `_auto_detect_fun` to ensure the generated request kwargs accurately reflect the body's intended encoding for the downstream Request object."}, {"fname": "_canonicalize_link_url", "evidence": "The target function parses a cURL command, which includes a URL. Canonicalizing the extracted URL to ensure consistency and proper formatting for the Request kwargs is a common and necessary step, making this utility or its underlying logic highly likely to be invoked."}, {"fname": "setlistdefault", "evidence": "The implementation `setlistdefault(self, key, default_list=())` suggests a method of a container class, likely one used to store and manage headers (which can be multi-valued).

The `guess_scheme` function, by adding 'http://' if a scheme is missing or 'file://' for file paths, ensures that the generated Request kwargs contain a complete and valid URL, which is crucial for making actual requests."}, {"fname": "get_key", "evidence": "The target function will parse a URL from the cURL command.

This function performs a direct check for URL protocol validity, which is a common step in robust parsing."}, {"fname": "_format_cookie", "evidence": "The target function `curl_to_request_kwargs` must parse and correctly represent all parts of a cURL command, including cookies.

When basic authentication is present, an 'Authorization' header must be generated, and this function is specifically designed to create the Base64-encoded value required for such a header."}, {"fname": "potentially_trustworthy", "evidence": "The target function extracts a URL from the cURL command. It is a common practice for functions processing external URLs to perform validation or security checks, and 'potentially_trustworthy' provides a specific check related to URL scheme and TLS protection, which could be part of the conversion process."}, {"fname": "tls_protected", "evidence": "This function performs a specific check for TLS-protected URL schemes. As the target function processes URLs extracted from cURL commands, it may invoke this utility directly or indirectly (e.g., via 'potentially_trustworthy' from Node 4) for validation or informational purposes regarding the URL's security."}, {"fname": "parse_url", "evidence": "The target function `curl_to_request_kwargs` will extract a URL string from the cURL command.

This `strip_url` function directly provides utilities for such URL normalization, making it a plausible invocation for preparing the URL for the request kwargs."}, {"fname": "add_http_if_no_scheme", "evidence": "cURL commands often allow URLs without an explicit scheme. This function ensures that a URL has a default scheme (http://) if one is missing, which is typically required for constructing valid HTTP requests. This aligns with the target function's goal of preparing a URL for a request."}, {"fname": "setlist", "evidence": "When parsing a cURL command, it's possible for the command to specify the same header multiple times (e.g., '-H \"X-Custom: val1\" -H \"X-Custom: val2\"'). A 'Headers' object, which would likely be part of the returned Request kwargs, needs a mechanism to store these as a list of values for that key. The 'setlist' method is designed precisely for this purpose, allowing the target function to correctly populate the headers object with all associated values."}, {"fname": "normkey", "evidence": "HTTP header names are case-insensitive. When parsing a cURL command, header names might be provided in various casings. To ensure consistency and proper lookup within the 'Headers' object that will be part of the Request kwargs, header keys need to be normalized to a canonical form.

This involves extracting arguments.
